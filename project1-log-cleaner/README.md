# 🧹 Project 1 – Log Cleaner

# 🚀 AWS EC2 Free Tier Setup Guide (All Steps in One Place)

## Step 1: Install AWS CLI
Follow AWS official docs: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html

Verify installation:
aws --version

Expected output:
aws-cli/2.15.X Python/3.X.X Windows/10 exe/AMD64

---

## Step 2: Create an IAM User with CLI Credentials
1. Log into AWS Console as Root user
2. Navigate to: IAM → Users → Add users
3. Enter a username (example: devops-admin)
4. Leave the “Provide user access to the AWS Management Console” unchecked 
   (you don’t need console login) and Click Next..
4. On Permissions step → Attach policies directly → select AdministratorAccess
5. Finish creating the user
6. Go to the user’s Security credentials tab
7. Under Access keys → Create access key
8. Choose “Command Line Interface (CLI)” as the use case
9. Copy Access Key ID and Secret Access Key (download the .csv file)

---

## Step 3: Configure AWS CLI
Run:
aws configure

Fill in:
AWS Access Key ID [None]: <Paste your Access Key ID>
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <Paste your Secret Access Key>
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json

This saves credentials into: ~/.aws/credentials

---

## Step 4: Verify Authentication
Run:
aws sts get-caller-identity

Expected output:
{
    "UserId": "AIDAEXAMPLE12345",
    "Account": "123456789012",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/devops-admin"
}

✅ If you see your account number and IAM username, authentication is successful.

---

## Step 5: Run `create_ubuntu_ec2.sh`

Clone or download this project to your local machine. If you are on Windows using Git Bash, convert Windows line endings and make the script executable:

dos2unix create_ubuntu_ec2.sh
chmod +x create_ubuntu_ec2.sh

Now run the script:

./create_ubuntu_ec2.sh

The script will:  
- ✅ Check if the key pair exists, or create a new one (`my-key-pair.pem`)  
- ✅ Check if the security group exists, or create one (`my-sg`) and allow SSH from your IP  
- ✅ Launch a new **Ubuntu 22.04 EC2 instance (t3.micro, free tier eligible)**  
- ✅ Wait until the instance is running  
- ✅ Print the **Instance ID** and **Public IP Address**

Example output:

===========================================
   🚀 AWS EC2 Free Tier Ubuntu Launcher
===========================================
🔑 Checking key pair...
⚠️  Key pair 'my-key-pair' already exists. Reusing it.
🔒 Checking security group...
⚠️  Security group 'my-sg' already exists (ID: sg-06c20cc616add109c). Reusing it.
🚀 Launching Ubuntu EC2 instance...
⏳ Waiting for instance (i-0abcd1234ef567890) to be running...
===========================================
✅ Ubuntu EC2 Instance Created Successfully!
   Instance ID : i-0abcd1234ef567890
   Public IP   : 3.91.25.111
   Key File    : /c/Users/YourName/my-key-pair.pem
===========================================

Finally, connect to your new EC2 instance (replace `<PUBLIC_IP>` with the one printed by the script):

ssh -i "$HOME/my-key-pair.pem" ubuntu@<PUBLIC_IP>

---

## Step 6: Run and Understand `log_cleaner.sh`

If you switch to the root user (`sudo -i`), first move into the ubuntu home directory where your script is saved:

cd /home/ubuntu

Then save your script as `log_cleaner.sh` and run it. If you are already root, you don’t need `sudo` for the following commands.

### Prepare the script
# 1. Convert Windows line endings to Linux
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install dos2unix -y
dos2unix log_cleaner.sh

# 2. Make script executable
chmod +x log_cleaner.sh

# 3. Run with bash (not sh), with sudo to allow log writes
sudo ./log_cleaner.sh --dry-run

### What the script does (module by module)
- **Header & Story** → Documents why the script exists (a 3 AM disk full incident).  
- **Configuration Section** → Sets which directory to clean (`/var/log`), how many days old files to target (`7`), and where to save logs (timestamped file under `/var/log/cleanup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`).  
- **Colors Section** → Defines ANSI color codes for nice terminal output (red = errors/warnings, green = success, yellow = warnings/info).  
- **log_message function** → Writes messages with timestamps to both the terminal and the log file.  
- **usage function** → Provides usage instructions (`--dry-run` option).  
- **Root Check** → Warns if not running as root (since some log files may not be deletable without elevated privileges).  
- **Argument Parsing** → Checks if `--dry-run` flag is passed. If yes, enables preview-only mode.  
- **Directory Check** → Verifies that `/var/log` exists before proceeding.  
- **Disk Usage Before** → Shows current disk usage for `/` and `/var`.  
- **Find Command Setup** → Uses `find` to locate `*.log*` files older than 7 days.  
- **Dry Run Mode** → Lists files that *would* be deleted, logs them, and shows total count.  
- **Real Run Mode** → Asks for confirmation, then deletes files one by one, logging both successes and failures. Tracks total number of deletions.  
- **Disk Usage After** → Shows disk usage after cleanup so you can verify space savings.  
- **Final Success Message** → Prints a fun success note (“You just saved the server. Go get coffee. ☕”).  
- **Log File Display** → At the end, shows the exact log file location and prints its contents so you can see what actions were logged.

This makes the script safe (dry-run mode), traceable (logs every action), and effective (frees disk space by cleaning old log files automatically).
