# ðŸ§¹ Project 1 â€“ Log Cleaner (Interview Explanation)

## STAR Points

**S â€“ Situation**  
A production server went down at 3 AM because disk usage hit 98%.  
Root cause: endless log files in `/var/log` filling the disk.  
Applications crashed, users were locked out, and services froze.

**T â€“ Task**  
Recover the server immediately and build a long-term automated solution  
so that old log files would never again cause outages.

**A â€“ Action**  
- Wrote a Bash script to monitor disk usage and clean logs older than 7 days.  
- Added a **dry-run mode** for safety (preview before deletion).  
- Implemented detailed logging of every action to timestamped files.  
- Introduced a `--force` flag for non-interactive automation (cron jobs).  
- Scheduled it with cron to run daily, storing logs in `/var/log/log_cleaner_cron_YYYYMMDD.log`.

**R â€“ Result**  
- Server restored within minutes, disk usage dropped immediately.  
- Prevented repeat incidents: no disk-related outages afterwards.  
- Improved uptime, stability, and confidence in production operations.  
- Reduced firefighting â†’ freed up the team to focus on proactive work.

## Short Version (30â€“40 sec)

*"We once had a production server go down at 3 AM because disk usage hit 98% due to uncontrolled log growth. My task was to restore the server and prevent this from happening again. I built a Bash script that checks disk usage, deletes logs older than 7 days, and logs every action. It includes a dry-run mode for safety and a `--force` flag for cron automation. Once deployed, the script restored space instantly and completely eliminated log-related outages, improving uptime and reducing firefighting."*

## Long Version (2â€“3 min)

*"At one point, we faced a serious incident at 3 AM when a production server stopped responding. Disk usage had reached 98%, caused by uncontrolled growth of log files in `/var/log`. Applications crashed, services froze, and users were locked out.  

My responsibility was not only to recover the server quickly but also to ensure this problem never happened again.  

I created a Bash script that continuously monitors disk usage, finds logs older than 7 days, and deletes them safely. To make it robust, I added multiple features: a **dry-run mode** to preview deletions without risk, a **detailed logging system** so every action is timestamped and auditable, and a `--force` flag so the script could run unattended via cron. Finally, I automated it with a cron job scheduled daily, storing per-day logs in `/var/log/log_cleaner_cron_YYYYMMDD.log`.  

The results were immediate. On the first run, disk usage dropped and the server recovered within minutes. More importantly, after automation, we never experienced a disk-full outage again. This significantly improved uptime and reliability, reduced late-night firefighting, and gave the team confidence that this risk was fully controlled. Overall, it demonstrated how automation, observability, and proactive maintenance can directly improve system stability."*
